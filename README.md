Stock Predictor ML Frontend

This is the frontend of the Stock Predictor ML project.
It provides a modern React-based interface where users can register, log in, and explore stock market insights.
The app displays live stock prices, market news, and allows predictions powered by the backend ML model.

The design is focused on simplicity and clarity: a semi-transparent UI, clean forms for login/register, and dynamic navigation that adapts based on authentication status.
